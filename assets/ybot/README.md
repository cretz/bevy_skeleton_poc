The ybot.dae file is from "Y Bot" at mixamo.com. It is converted to gltf with
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/COLLADA2GLTF by running

    COLLADA2GLTF ybot.dae ybot.gltf

**Fix**

Due to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1785, the workaround at
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1785#issuecomment-809669059 has been performed and saved as `ybot-fixed.gltf`
